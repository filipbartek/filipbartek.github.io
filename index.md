I am an aspiring game developer and amateur philosopher.

My favorite technologies have recently been [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), Python and C++.

Programming tasks that get me excited:

* computationally difficult problems
* optimization
* backend programming
* artificial intelligence
* computer games
